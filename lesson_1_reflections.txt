How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It could only be on the found lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Faster work because I can go back to old solutions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pro: logical and meaningfull changes
con: crashes, small changes can be tracked

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Idea of a coherent project

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Cause it's easy to go back and find the code leading to the problem

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
